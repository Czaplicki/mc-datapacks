Czaplicki-GUI is a dark, vanilla inspired GUI and HUD overhaul.
Where the vanilla boarders from inside of the recipe book, beacon and effects
GUI, is taken and made to replace all the old school gray boarders offered by
vanilla. Then buttons where made to fit the theme, text inside GUI's
where colored to cyan, so that the text would be easy to read against the dark
background but still be easy on the eyes. Icons where mostly unchanged, except
for minor tweaks like noise reduction. Lastly the HUD was modified for a
coherent feel.

Hope you enjoy it, best wishes :
